# NYPL Menu Search

An alternate, local (non-web) tool for searching through the [NYPL menu archives](//menus.nypl.org), tied together with recipes
from [Yummly's](//yummly.com) data feed.

## Version notes
Currently designed to work with a MySQL backup of the NYPL menus, as opposed to calling that via API.
